    <h1>Project on console</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.
        Visual Studio Code supports macOS, Linux, and Windows - so you can hit the ground running, no matter the platform.</p>

        <p> Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It is connected to another computer, server, or mainframe and is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term is most commonly used when referring to a system used to control one or more servers. Modern consoles provide a graphical user interface used to control machines on a Local Area Network (LAN) to provide remote access to remote systems. To navigate the graphical interfaces, these consoles usually include a mouse.</p>
